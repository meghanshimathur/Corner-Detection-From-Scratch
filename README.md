# Corner Detection From Scratch (Harris + FAST + Multi-Scale)

This project implements **corner detection algorithms from scratch** in Python, including:

- Harris Corner Detector  
- FAST Corner Detector  
- Multi-Scale Harris Detector  

The goal is to understand how classical computer vision feature detectors work internally, without relying on built-in OpenCV functions.
